This is a [Cuba](http://cuba.is/) app but is deployed as static pages on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Cuba makes it easy when writing/developing. Run `shotgun` and you're in business.

To deploy, run `rake generate` to turn the Cuba app into static pages. Then git add, commit, and push everything up to the master branch on Github.
