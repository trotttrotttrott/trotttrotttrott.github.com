An a/b/y pedal at the beginning of the chain selects between clean and distortion signal paths.

The clean path contains a Keeley Red Dirt and a Benson Monarch combo.

The distortion path contains a Retro Mechanical Labs Electron Fuzz, an MXR M108S Ten Band EQ, a Mesa Boogie Stereo 2:Fifty, and a Marshall 2x12 cabinet.

Unique to the clean channel is a send/return pedal that integrates with modular components. The appeal of integrating with modular is the use of time-based effects that are synchronized with clocks that are also controlling other time-based, modular components like sequencers.

At this time, the only modular effect used with guitar is the 4ms Dual Looping Delay. The Doepher A-119 is used for input and the MengQiMusic Please Exist 2 is used for output.

### Microphone, Modular

```
+-----+ +------------+
| mic | | modular    |
+-+---+ +-+------^-+-+
  |       |      | |
  |       |      | |

+-v--+    |      +-v-----------+
| PA |    +------+ el capistan |
+----+           +-------------+
```

Modular components output directly to a channel of the mixer. Other components are in the aux loop.

The Mackie Mix8 has only a single aux loop so all inputs share it - mic and modular.
