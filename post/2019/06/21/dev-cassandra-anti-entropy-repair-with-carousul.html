<p>A few definitions for context...</p>

<h6><a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a></h6>

<p>A masterless, multi-node, multi-region database that boasts linear scalability, high availability, and fault tolerance.</p>

<h6><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(disambiguation)">Entropy</a></h6>

<p>In the case of databases, the tendency to become increasingly disordered. Frequent data deletions and downed nodes are common causes.</p>

<h6>Anti-entropy Repair</h6>

<p>The act of reconciling disorder within a database system. It&#39;s performed to ensure data consistency across replicas.</p>

<h3>Problem</h3>

<p>Cassandra does not perform anti-entropy repair automatically. However, the <a href="https://docs.datastax.com/en/archived/cassandra/3.0/cassandra/tools/toolsNodetool.html">nodetool utility</a> provides the <a href="https://docs.datastax.com/en/archived/cassandra/3.0/cassandra/tools/toolsRepair.html"><code>nodetool repair</code></a> command for performing it. It&#39;s <a href="https://docs.datastax.com/en/archived/cassandra/3.0/cassandra/operations/opsRepairNodesTOC.html">documented</a> that operators should &quot;...use nodetool repair as part of your regular maintenance routine...&quot;. But who even has a regular maintenance routine in 2019? It seems to me a more honest recommendation would be to automate this as well as you can because it&#39;s too complicated for a masterless, distributed database cluster to coordinate automatically out of the box.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve observed that there&#39;s a fair amount of confusion regarding which nodes must run <code>nodetool repair</code> to fully repair a cluster. Though some are dated, the following threads demonstrate this...</p>

<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54006795/cassandra-sequential-repair-does-not-repair-all-nodes-on-one-run">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54006795/cassandra-sequential-repair-does-not-repair-all-nodes-on-one-run</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The accepted answer from the first link states that you only need to run the repair operation on one node in a cluster and you&#39;re done. The accepted answer of the second states that you need to run repair on every node in the cluster. The third answer aligns with the second - every single node.</p>

<p>Depending on replication factors and node counts, each answer may be true. For example, if each datacenter has 3 nodes and your replication factor is 3, then running repair on a single node may be adequate for completing the job. However, if each datacenter has 5 nodes and your replication factor is 3, then you are only guaranteed to have repaired 3/5 of all data.</p>

<p>In the latter case, you must run repair on all nodes at least within a single datacenter to repair all data. I say, &quot;at least&quot;, because more repairs may be required if replication factors are not consistent among datacenters. On top of that, only one node can be repaired at a time.</p>

<p>One more definition...</p>

<h6><a href="https://www.consul.io/"><strong>Consul</strong></a></h6>

<p>A distributed service mesh. It can also be described as a key/value store, event system, and DNS resolver. In addition to all of that, it provides a <a href="https://www.consul.io/docs/internals/sessions.html">session mechanism</a> that can be used for building distributed locks.</p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<p>Automate the repair of all nodes within a single datacenter, one at a time. &quot;Carousul&quot; is what I came up with - <a href="https://github.com/trotttrotttrott/carousul">https://github.com/trotttrotttrott/carousul</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a Go program that performs datacenter parallel repairs while using Consul for distributed locking to ensure that only the node that holds the lock can perform a repair. Repairs are performed one by one until each has had a turn obtaining the lock and completing the repair operation.</p>

<p>In addition, it outputs metrics to file for a Prometheus <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter#textfile-collector">node exporter textfile collector</a> to consume.</p>

<p>Carousul&#39;s limitation is that it can only run in a single datacenter at a time because Consul cannot hold sessions across datacenters. This is fine if you only need to run repair in a single datacenter to complete the job. If not, this is not a complete solution - further synchronization must occur.</p>
