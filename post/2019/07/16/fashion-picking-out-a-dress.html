    <h2>Picking Out a Dress . <small>07/16/2019</small></h2>

<p>I lived in LA for a few years, and therefore, I inherently have a <strong><em>passion for fashion</em></strong>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to a good friend&#39;s wedding in a few days with my girlfriend. The bride and groom announced their expectant guest attire to be &quot;desert chic&quot;. My girlfriend expressed some concern. Hence my passion for fashion, I offered to send ideas.</p>

<p>I suppose when you go to weddings, folks that go together can attempt to coordinate. I made this difficult for her by picking my outfit first. I figured I might as well superimpose a bunch of dresses with a picture of my outfit in Photoshop to help consider options. I then took screen captures and texted them to her. <strong>It was not helpful...</strong></p>

<p>First photo I sent. This was a rebound after learning I couldn&#39;t have the dresses in the next image shipped in time. I do love the yellow leopard though.</p>

<p>I wanted all of these, but again, they wouldn&#39;t make it on time. These are from <a href="https://www.oshoplive.com/">OSHOPLIVE</a>. I didn&#39;t realize it at first but they are based in the UK and they wouldn&#39;t be able to reliably get the dresses to us on time.</p>

<p>The first image and all proceeding images are from <a href="https://www.lulus.com/">LuLu&#39;s Fashion Lounge</a>. They have next day fulfillment/shipping in the US.</p>

<p>I sent a lot of pictures. Finally a recap with basically all superimposed dresses/models present.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t care for any of the dresses in particular at the end. I liked them all, but none stood out.</p>

<p>But then I did one more pass through on LuLu&#39;s and I found the perfect dress. I didn&#39;t send a picture. It was obvious.</p>

<p><em>...will update post with photo when it arrives...</em></p>

<h3><em>UPDATE - 7/25</em></h3>

<p>THE DRESS...</p>
