### About
I'm currently focused on web development with Ruby and other technologies that complement Ruby based stacks. I have a strong front-end development foundation, however, I've been mostly spending time on application architecture, infrastructure automation and continuous delivery. My roots as a programmer began with building instruments and effects modules with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaktor" target="_blank">Reaktor</a>. Later, I became interested in client side web technologies like Javascript and Actionscript. These eventually led me to the server side - PHP, JAVA, Groovy, and finally Ruby.

### Interests
* _Web frameworks/DSLs_: Rails, Sinatra.
* _Front-end_: Haml, SCSS, Coffeescript.
* _Provisioning_: Chef.
* _Persistence_: MySQL, Postgres, Redis.
* _Cloud Application Platforms_: Amazon EC2, Rackspace, Heroku.
* _Editors_: Vim.
* _OS_: Mac, Linux.
* _Graphics_: ImageMagick, Photoshop, Illustrator.
