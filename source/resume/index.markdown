### About
I enjoy web development with Ruby and other technologies that complement Ruby based stacks. I have a strong front-end foundation, but in the last year I've spent most of my time on backend application work, infrastructure automation and continuous delivery. My roots as a programmer began with building instruments and effects modules with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaktor" target="_blank">Reaktor</a>. Later, I became interested in client side web tech - Javascript, Actionscript. These eventually led me to the server side (in chronological order) - PHP, Java, Groovy, and finally Ruby.

### Interests
* _Web frameworks/DSLs_: Rails, Sinatra.
* _HTML/CSS/Javascript Abstractions_: Haml, Slim, Sass, CoffeeScript.
* _Javascript libraries/frameworks_: jQuery, Backbone, Ember.
* _Automation/Virtualization_: Chef, Vagrant, VirtualBox.
* _Persistence_: MySQL, Postgres, Redis, MongoDB.
* _Cloud Computing/Platforms_: AWS, Rackspace, Heroku.
* _Editors_: Vim.
* _OS_: Mac, Linux.
* _Graphics_: Photoshop, Illustrator, ImageMagick/RMagick.
